# FISHR2
This is the newest version of FISHR which detects IBD segments between individuals.

#For a For a complete worked through example, see  the following R Script:

# FISHR2

This is the newest version of the FISHR (Find IBD Shared Haplotypes Rapidly) program. Major changes from V1:
1) Can be used with -hapsfile, -sample file, -geneticmapfile
2) Always reduced
3) no outfile or bin_out
4) use "./FISHR2 -help" command to view the list of flags and their usuage.

- 3. If you want to install git use:
	- For ubuntu based system:
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install git
	- For Mac users, visit the link below and follow the instructions:

To Compile FISHR2: 
- Navigate to folder where the makefile exists and type 'make' in your command line. 
- This will create a binary file FISHR2 in the directory.
- To execute the program refer the samples below.



Note:

-  Can be used in parallel with Germline
-  Can be used with (.hap, .sample,.gen files) as well as (.ped and .map files) as well as (.hap, .sample and .map files).

Known Issues:
See Instructions.txt
- Don't have git installed, see the "To Download" above for instructions.
- Boost libraries missing:
FIX: sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev.
Use the commmand above to install boost in your Unix/mac system.

- If thre's a problem installing boost, there is a binary  file called 'FISHR2' already included. You needn't compile it. You can just start using it. See the Samples Below.


Extra/New features:
- To use -gen, -hap, -map files use:
 -geneticmapfile ./src/<filename>.gen -samplefile ./<filename>.sample -hapsfile ./<filename> 
- Specifying -germline_output ./newFolderHere/ with put the output generated by germline in the specified path.
- To use -ibd2
-ibd2 thresholdvalue


It will create that new folder if it doesn't exists, if folder already exists it uses the existing folder. 
Not mentioning the -germline_output, will not output any file generated by germline.
