#How to compile:

In the FISHR2 directory execute the following:
./compile.sh

This will compile the following 3 programs:
- FISHR2
- IE_CALCULATOR utility
- PARAMETER_FINDER utility

Incase there are some errors compile one or more of the above programs, you can safely compile each of them individually:

- To compile FISHR2
make FISHR2

- To compile IE_CALCULATOR
make IE_CALCULATOR

- To compile  PARAMETER_FINDER
make PARAMETER_FINDER


Known Issues / Solutions:
- Don't have git installed, see the "To Download" above for instructions.
- Boost libraries missing:
FIX: sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev.
Use the commmand above to install boost in your Unix/mac system.

- If thre's a problem installing boost, there is a binary  file called 'FISHR2' already included. You needn't compile it. You can just start using it. See the Samples in README.md.
